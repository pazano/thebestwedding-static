        <h2>It was love at first rave.</h2>
        <p>Long ago in 2011 in a magical land known as Los Angeles,&nbsp;Danielle was absorbing the days of her youth as wild free spirit and on a whim decided to attend a rave on her own. Wandering around the concert landscape, she ran into a group of college friends and one freshly-turned-30 year-old stud she didn’t recognize. His name was Paul and he was not pleased that they had stopped serving beer, but he did tap his toes on occasion.&nbsp;They stood close to each other and exchanged 17 words, none of them a phone number, and at the end of the concert, Danielle vanished into the night.</p>
        <p>Two weeks later in line for the bathroom at a club, Paul spotted a familiar face. “DANIELLE!” he gasped aloud waving at her as he approached.</p>
        <p>“YOU…” Danielle said, searching the foggy memories of her tequila-ladden brain to find a recollection of who this dude was.</p>
        <p>Unphased by her sudden memory loss, she followed Paul to the dance floor where they raised the roof and also made out.</p>
        <p>The rest, as they say, got a lot more complicated and then really, really good and now they’re getting married!</p>

        <h2>Our love climbs mountains.</h2>
        <p>“We have to get to the hike,” Paul said. “No more stops on the side of the road or we’ll lose the light.”</p>
        <p>Geez, Paul sure has gotten in to hiking,&nbsp;Danielle thought. It would have been nice to see another Scottish Cow, but whatever, a hike’s cool too.</p>
        <p>They were road tripping through the highlands on their way to Ballachulish, Scotland and every inch of the landscape was tempting her to pull out her camera and capture a new memory.</p>
        <p>The air was electric with the smell of rain and mist coagulated into tiny droplets that beaded on their jackets and dripped down the seams. As they got out of the car at the foot of a forested mountain, they looked at the unreal greenery towering around them. They were at the foot of Grey Mare’s Trail.</p>
        <p>Their feet sank into each step and pulled out with wet thwops as they climbed further up the path, through the forest, under a waterfall, and across countless bogs.</p>
        <p>“There’s an abandoned house at the top of this trail,” Paul said. “We gotta get there soon, the sun is setting.”</p>
        <p>This must be some view for Paul to be in such a hurry, Danielle thought. She had let Paul take care of this part of the planning and knew he had probably thoroughly researched it, so who was she to question?</p>
        <p>“There it is,” Paul said. On the peak of the mountain overlooking the hills of the Highlands was a massive white hostel with cracked windows and boarded up doors. The rain could be heard dripping through the pipes, echoing through it’s interior.</p>
        <p>“Let’s do a photo,” Paul said. “Set up the tripod.”</p>
        <p>Dang, Paul is really getting into this photography thing, Danielle thought as she unloaded and extended the sticks, not paying attention to a fumbling Paul on the other side of the lens.</p>
        <p>Using a remote, Danielle clicked to set up a test shot of Paul and thought, “Eh, looks alright” and hopped into the shot.</p>
        <p>Holding her hand, Paul styled and posed them for an Instagram-worthy image. His hand was trembling.</p>
        <p>“First let’s take one facing the camera,” he said, as he handed her the remote. She pressed the button.</p>
        <p>CLICK.</p>
        <p>“Now let’s take one facing each other,”&nbsp;he said, grabbing her other hand with his.</p>
        <p>CLICK.</p>
        <p>“Now one where I get down on one knee.”</p>
        <p>CLICK.</p>
        <p>Long story short, Paul cried and Danielle said yes because he chose a bomb ring and is a pretty swell guy.</p>

        <h2>And now we're gonna have a big, bougie, emotional, fun, dance-your-socks-off kind of wedding.</h2>
        <p>So pack your box of tissues and dust off those dancing shoes, because we're about to party like there is a lot of tomorrows because we want our marriage to last a really long time, and if there is no tomorrow, well, that would kinda suck.</p>
